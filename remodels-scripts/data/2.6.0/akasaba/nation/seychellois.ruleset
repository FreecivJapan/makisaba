 Eastern Africa in the Indian Ocean. The Islands have been visited by\
 Austronesian, Maldivian and Arab merchants in antiquity but by the\
 time of the European discoveries the Seychelles had no indigenous\
 population. The Seychelles were intermittently under French and British\
 possession until becoming independent in 1976. Its population consists\
 of people of African, Chinese, European, Indian and Malagasy descent.\
 The Seychelles are the least populated country of Africa and have the\
 highest human development of the continent.")
